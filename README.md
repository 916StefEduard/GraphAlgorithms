# GraphAlgorithms

Graph Application Involving some of the Most Famous Graph Algorithms.

1. Data is read from a file and a graph is created and we have a console menu with about 20 applications on that graph.
2. Some basic ones like the indegree or outdegree of a given vertex, adding/removing a vertex from the graph or listing
the inbound/outbound edges of a given vertex.
3. Reading and writing the graph construction to a file and printing the graph in its [start,end] vertex format.
4. And a couple that are more advanced like finding the minimum cost walk using a the adjacency matrix,
constructing the minimum spanning tree using the Kruskal's algorithm or the minimum cost Hamiltonian graph.
