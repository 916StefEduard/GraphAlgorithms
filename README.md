# GraphAlgorithms

A Graph Application Involving Some of the Most Famous Graph Algorithms

1. Data is read from a file, a graph is created, and we have a console menu with about 20 features on that graph.
2. Some basic ones, like the indegree or outdegree of a given vertex, adding or removing a vertex from the graph or listing,
The inbound and outbound edges of a given vertex
3. Reading and writing the graph construction to a file, as well as printing the graph in [start, end] vertex format.
4. And a couple that are more advanced, like finding the minimum cost walk using the adjacency matrix or
Constructing the minimum spanning tree using the Kruskal's algorithm
5. Taking a look at the minimum cost Hamiltonian graph problem, which is a P vs NP problem,
6. Also, one interesting feature of the program is the random graph generator, which is cycle-proof.

Very large, large, and small graph samples are also included.
